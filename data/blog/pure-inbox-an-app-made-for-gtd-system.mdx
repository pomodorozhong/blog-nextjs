## Introduction

Pure Inbox is an iOS app, made by me. It helps you better capture your ideas. Once you captured enough ideas, it then helps you process them.

You can [download the beta version of it here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/H99p1rTp), through TestFlight.

## The Goal of the App

You can create content within the app, and also share content from another app to this app. Pure Inbox will encourage you to periodically take action on the content you collected to empty the inbox. Acting exactly like the "Inbox" in a [GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) system.

Although it is designed to work with a GTD system, it can be used alone. When you use it alone, it can be used as a memo app, or you can treat it like the "[Saved Messages](https://telegram.org/blog/albums-saved-messages#saved-messages)" in [Telegram](https://telegram.org), and the "[Keep Memo](https://help.line.me/line/android/pc?lang=en&contentId=20017696)" in [LINE](https://line.me/en/).

## Feedback Needed

This app is still under heavy development. There are a lot of functions still on the way. And I need your feedback to set my priorities straight.

So if you're interested in the idea of this app, please try it out, and tell me what you think. Below is my contact info, Iâ€™m eager to receive your feedback!

## Roadmap

The following list contains features I plan to add to the app. It is sorted by how easy it is to implement, and how badly I personally want to use it.

I find it challenging to determine what should be on this list, and which of it should I implement first. This is why I need your feedback.

- [x] `Item count indicator`: a number on the top right corner of the screen, with colors that turn red when there are too many items there
- [x] `Clearing Page`: a page that helps you to concentrate on one item at a time
- [x] `Trash can`: to preserve recently deleted items
- [ ] `Better link`: a link in a text will be highlighted, also the icon and the title of the website will be shown
- [ ] `Image support`: be able to add and view images in the app
- [ ] `Charts`: show you how many items you collect over time, and how fast you process them, helping you achieve "Inbox Zero" more often
- [ ] `Sync with iCloud`: so the content in the app will sync across your Apple devices
- [ ] `macOS client`: so we can utilize the desktop environment when clearing item
- [ ] `Optimize UI for iPad`
- [ ] `Themeing`
- [ ] `Voice memo`: be able to add and listen to a voice recording in the app
- [ ] `Tag`: so we can group similar items
- [ ] `Widget`
