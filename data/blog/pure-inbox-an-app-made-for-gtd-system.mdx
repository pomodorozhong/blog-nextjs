## Introduction

Pure Inbox is a stand-alone Inbox app for GTD system, [available on App Store for free](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pure-inbox/id1622170958?itsct=apps_box_link&itscg=30200).

The goal of the app is to overcome the downside of using the inbox in a To-Do app as GTD Inbox, and also provide some unique functions that would benefit a GTD system.

## Roadmap

The following list contains features I plan to add to the app.

I find it challenging to determine what should be on this list, and which of it should I implement first. This is why I need your feedback.

- `Tag`: So we can group related items, or filter out the irrelevance to prevent distraction.
- `Better link`: a link in a text will be highlighted, also the icon and the title of the website will be shown
- `Image support`: be able to add and view images in the app
- `Charts`: to gain some insight into how you process your captures and achieve Inbox Zero more often.
- `Widget`: to add new items or to view recent captures by using a widget
- `Sync with iCloud`: so the content in the app will sync across your Apple devices
- `Optimize UI for iPad`
- `macOS client`: so we can utilize the desktop environment when clearing item
- `File support`: be able to add and view arbitrary files in the app
- `Themeing`
- `Voice memo`: be able to add and listen to a voice recording in the app
