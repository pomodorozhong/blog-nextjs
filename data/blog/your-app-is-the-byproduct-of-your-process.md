I believe it also applies to programming an app.

So, rather than making an app as perfect as possible upfront, I am aiming for forging a great process.

## Isn't it "Yak Shaving"?

It may be, but I believe that's not really a bad thing.

For example, the CI/CD thingy, that whole industry is a gigantic yak shaving factory, and everybody loves it!

Also, take a look at Slack, the popular messaging app, [it basically came out of a yak shaving](https://nira.com/slack-history/). The team focused on improving their process (as their internal communication), and they did get a great product, just like what I quote above.

Even though it may not be THE product they initially expected, it sure is A product we all enjoy.

## So what makes a great process when programming an app?

For the time being, I think these are the most promising things to make a great process:

- Iterating the MVP
- Building **actual** reusable components
- Minimal but crucial unit-testing
- Proper tooling

But I'm only starting to figure it out, just [weeks ago I was still being forced on others' processes](/posts/i-quit). So take my words with a grain of salt.

Nevertheless, I will be experimenting with all those promising technique, bit by bit, and hopefully, I will find out what makes a great process.
