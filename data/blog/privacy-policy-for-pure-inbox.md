## Purchase History Usage

This app uses [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) to make sure the in-app purchase works smoothly.

Besides the bare minimum requirement for the RevenueCat, Pure Inbox does not collect any other information from the users.

And what RevenueCat collect is anonymous information, it can't be used to identify individual users. [Click here, to learn more about RevenueCat's Apple App Privacy Disclosure](https://docs.revenuecat.com/docs/apple-app-privacy).
