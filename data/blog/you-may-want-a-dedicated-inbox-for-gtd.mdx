I have implemented [GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) in my work and life for over 10 years. After trying Evernote, Notion, Todoist, OmniFocus, and more, I still can't get an ideal Inbox experience for my workflow.

## Inbox inside a To-Do app works, but...

It kinda works, using the inbox of a To-Do app (or the default notebook of a Note app) as the GTD Inbox, but that raises some annoyances:

- **It's not always frictionless to add a new item**: Before you can save what you type or even before you can type in anything, some app requires you to enter more metadata, like Title, or Category.
- **There are too many distractions**: It might be your pending task, your ongoing project, or a comment from your coworker.
- **It's not always easy to share content to another tool**: Even an intention as simple as "copy this text to another app" often requires you to click through tons of buttons.

## Stand-alone Inbox can do so much more

A stand-alone Inbox can not only solve the annoyances mentioned above but also provide some unique functions that would benefit a GTD system.

- **It can motivate you to clear your Inbox more frequently**: by a notification system or some habit tracker alike system.
- **It can help you to clear your Inbox more effortlessly**: by generating action suggestions based on your past behavior, or simply grouping similar items.
- **It can give you insights about your Inbox usage, so you know what to improve when doing the GTD review**

## I'm building one myself

I believe a stand-alone GTD Inbox would be awesome, yet there is no such app on the market. So I decided to build it myself.

I spent the past four months learning iOS development while building it. And today I'm very excited to show you the prototype of my vision - Pure Inbox.

If you're interested in this idea, please give it a try, and don't forget to tell me what you think about it. I will keep improving the app based on your feedback!
